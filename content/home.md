## Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, 5th Edition

### Randall C. O'Reilly, Yuko Munakata, Michael J. Frank, Thomas E. Hazy, and Contributors

This is the 5th edition of the online, freely available textbook, providing a complete, self-contained introduction to the field of **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**, where computer models of the brain are used to understand a wide range of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, learning, memory, motor control, executive function, and language.

The first part of this textbook develops a coherent set of computational and neural principles that capture the behavior of networks of interconnected neurons, and the second part applies these principles to understand the cognitive functions listed above.

See [[sims]] for associated simulation models for this book. 

This book is available for download in a variety of formats:

* [PDF](https://github.com/compcogneuro/book/releases/latest/download/ccnbook_ed5.pdf) --- This version has the best formatting.

* [ePub](https://github.com/compcogneuro/book/releases/latest/download/ccnbook_ed5.epub) --- You can download this file and email it to yourself at your [Amazon Kindle account](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email) to get it on your Kindle. You can also open it in the macOS Books app.

* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFWMZYWJ) --- You can pay to get the book on your Kindle or as a paperback version in color. These options are priced as low as possible.

* [HTML](https://github.com/compcogneuro/book/releases/latest/download/ccnbook_ed5.html) --- This does not display all of the math correctly, so you should use one of the other formats above for Chapters 2 and 4.
